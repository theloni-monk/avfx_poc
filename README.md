# AVFX_POC: Audio/Visual Effects Proof of Concept

_*Goal*_: Trying to appy temporal audio effects like reverb to a video.

In the future I would implement this in a compute shader or something faster than python

## Dependencies:
 * Mydia for loading video to tensor
 * OpenCV2 for saving/playing video
 * Numpy for messing with the tensor
 * Pysndfx for appying audio effects to numpy 1-arrays
